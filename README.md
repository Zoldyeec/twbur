# let's get started
The first team with 4 members started this project on 22 Mar 2017. The old project can be played on console log.
We decided to work on the GUI (JavaFX) and started with 2 members remained and one new member on 13 Nov 2017.

# about
This project is about a text adventure. You can choose between some paths to play the story.
While some paths lead to death the correct one will lead to a city where the player can do some quests and solve puzzles.
I created a whole city but it's not imported yet.

# current state
The project is still unfinished and only 5 scenes are imported from the old project.
After the evaluation the game has to pause until the two remaining members will continue again.
There might be an engine for the storywriting in the future.

# copyright
This project is not used for any commercials. All rights will be served to their respected owner.
The images and music files will be used for tests. If we plan to launch it, we will create new images and sounds.
